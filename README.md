# Installation 
Make sure you have Node.js v14+

     1. `npm i` to install dependancies
     2. `npm run dev` to run locally (assuming you're running the backend locally as well)
     3. `npm run staged` to use the xornet backend if you're only planning on working on the front end
  2. Reporter: 
     1. `npm i` to install dependancies
     2. `npm run dev` to run locally (assuming you're running the backend locally as well)
     4. `npm run staged` to make the reporter connect to the backend instead of your local backend
  3. Server:
     1. `npm i` to install dependancies
     2. `npm run dev` to run locally (prod is only for the master server)
